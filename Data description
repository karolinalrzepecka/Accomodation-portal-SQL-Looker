**Exchanges**: 

Conversation/exchanges initiated or received by users who have subscribed
To identify how the activity influences the renewal
It is possible that we have several typologies of users (some who leave all year long, others only in summer,...). So the volume of exchanges alone is not enough to understand the renewal

- conversation_id
- exchange_id
- created_at: date of creation of the conversation (=exchange request)
- creator_id: id of the user who initiated the request
- guest_user_id
- host_user_id
- finalized_at: date when the exchange was finalized (if null, it means that the exchange request was not successful)
- canceled_at: date when the finalized exchange has been cancelled
- start_on: date when the exchange starts (can be filled in even if the exchange is not finalized. It corresponds to the requested dates)
- end_on: date when the exchange ends (can be filled in even if the exchange is not finalized. It corresponds to the requested dates)
- guest_count: number of people coming
- night_count: number of nights of the exchange
- user_cancellation_id: user_id who canceled
- exchange_type: via Guest Points or reciprocal
if the exchange is reciprocal, only one conversation is created (via the creator_id we know who initiated the request), but two exchanges are created
(with the guest_user_id and host_user_id reversed)
So be careful if you want to count the requests made, the requests received, or the exchanges :)
- home_type: house or appartment
- residence_type: main or secondary house
- capacity: maximum number of people who can come
- country: host house country
- region: host house region
- department: host house department
- city: host house city

**Subscriptions**: 

Sample of subscriptions since 2019 (particular context in 2020/2021)
If a user has subscribed several years, there are as many lines as subscriptions
If renew = 1 , you will find the subscription line and the renewal line for the next year

- subscription_date
- user_id
- renew: did the user re-subscribe the following year (the month of the expiration of his subscription)
- first_subscription_date
- first_subscription: 1 if it's the first subscription of the user (+ the users are old + they re-subscribe)
- referral: 1 if the user has been sponsored
- promotion: 1 if the user had a promotion for his subscription
- payment3x: 1 if the user has used the 3x payment to subscribe
- payment2: 1 if the user has paid his 2nd payment
- payment3: 1 if the user has paid his 3rd payment
- country: user country
- region: user region
- department: user department
- city: user city
